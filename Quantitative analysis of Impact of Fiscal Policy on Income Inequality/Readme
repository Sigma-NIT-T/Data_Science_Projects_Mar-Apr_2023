# Project Name: Fiscal Policies and Income Inequality Impact Study

This project aims to study the impact made by fiscal policies in reducing income inequality. It involves collecting and processing data from various government resources to build time series models based on ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average). The project also includes two separate time series models: one to capture the general trend using previous data and another to isolate the trend specifically caused by the implemented fiscal policies. The difference between these two models is analyzed to understand the impact of the policies on income inequality.

## Introduction

Income inequality is a pressing issue in many societies, and fiscal policies play a crucial role in addressing this disparity. This project aims to analyze the impact of fiscal policies on income inequality by employing time series analysis techniques. The project involves collecting data from various government resources, processing it, and building ARIMA models to study the general trend and the specific impact caused by implemented policies.

## Data Collection and Processing

The project relies on data collected from various government resources. The data collection process involves accessing and retrieving relevant datasets related to income distribution, fiscal policies, and other socio-economic factors. Once collected, the data is preprocessed to ensure consistency, handle missing values, and create suitable time series datasets.

## ARIMA Models

ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) models are used to analyze the time series data. Two separate ARIMA models are employed:

1. **General Trend Model**: This model captures the general trend in income inequality over time using historical data. It provides insights into the overall pattern and behavior of income inequality.
2. **Policy Impact Model**: This model isolates the specific impact of implemented fiscal policies on income inequality. By using complete data, it allows the analysis of the changes caused by the policies and their effectiveness in reducing income inequality.

The difference between the predictions of the general trend model and the policy impact model is studied to understand the direct influence of fiscal policies on income inequality.

## Enhancing Model Accuracy

To increase the accuracy of the models, the project focuses on collecting and synthesizing additional data points that may impact income inequality. This includes exploring additional socio-economic indicators, demographic data, and policy-specific information. By incorporating more relevant features into the models, we aim to improve their predictive power and provide more accurate insights.

## Casual Impact

In addition to the ARIMA models, the project is also exploring the use of LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) models for time series analysis. LSTM models are known for their ability to capture long-term dependencies and patterns in sequential data. By incorporating LSTM models, we aim to build optimized time series models that can better understand and predict the impact of fiscal policies on income inequality.
